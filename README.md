## üìã Challenge Overview


The 1MRC Challenge is simple yet demanding. You‚Äôll be working with a large dataset, handling tasks like chunked file reading, parallel processing, and optimized memory usage. Your goal is to process the data as efficiently as possible within the limits of your system.

### Your Task
- Parse 1 million rows from a CSV file and perform specified operations on the data (such as aggregation, filtering, or transformations).
- Optimize your code for performance by chunking, parallel processing, or other means.

## üìù Challenge Rules

1. **Data Handling**: The challenge involves working with a CSV file containing 1 million rows.
2. **Programming Language**: Use js/ts, your submission must include:
   - Code with comments explaining your approach.
   - A README file explaining how to run your code.
3. **Optimization**: Aim for maximum performance in terms of both memory and speed.
4. **Documentation**: Document your approach, techniques used, and any challenges faced.
