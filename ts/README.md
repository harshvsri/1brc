# 1BRC Challenge

Welcome to the **1BRC (1 Billion Rows Challenge)**! ðŸš€ 
This challenge was designed to test your data handling, processing skills, and performance optimization knowledge by parsing, analyzing, and extracting insights from massive datasets.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge is simple yet demanding. Youâ€™ll be working with a large dataset, handling tasks like chunked file reading, parallel processing, and optimized memory usage. Your goal is to process the data as efficiently as possible within the limits of your system.

- Parse a billion rows from a CSV file and perform specified operations on the data (such as aggregation, filtering, or transformations).
- Optimize your code for performance by chunking, parallel processing, or other means.
